# belly-button-challenge
An interactive webpage, that is built using Javascript, to see what different bacteria live in a variety of belly buttons.

The horizontal bar chart displays the top 10 OTU's found depending on the subject, chosen from the dropdown menu. The graph's x-axis is the sample values and the y-axis is the OTUs

The bubble chart represents the number of bacteria in a sample value. With, this time, the x-axis representing the OTUs and the y-axis representing the sample values. The different colors and sizes are for the OTU ids.

The dropdown box, or Test subject ID Number, has the different subjects.
